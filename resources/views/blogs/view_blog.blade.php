                            <p>Though cliché, knowledge is truly power in helping to win the battle with eczema. Informing yourself about it is the most powerful weapon you have in your crusade to living an eczema-free life.</p>
                            <p>Often people -- even those within our own personal social circles -- may lack the awareness and understanding of what eczema is, how much it can affect your life, and what you can do about it.</p>
                            <p>There are a few different ways to educate yourself about eczema. If I could go back to my childhood and do one thing differently, I would have been more creative about how I informed myself.

                    <p>In addition to asking the doctor relevant questions and making the most of their advice, there are other things that you should consider when it comes to becoming more informed.</p>
                    <p>Try checking the websites for national and international eczema or dermatology organizations because they provide an ideal platform for sharing and connecting with others. Their stories can help you understand your own better. </p>
                    <p>For years without realizing it, I had thought that my uphill battle with eczema was a struggle that only I dealt with and that no one else could relate to. I still remember reading other people’s stories from other parts of the world and realizing that I was not alone in my struggle. </p>
                    <p>I found myself in almost disbelief reading the in-depth entries of others that seemed to be almost identical to my own. Finding these shared struggles can provide its own form of strength along with the ability to educate yourself.</p>
                    <p>Eczema is a challenging disease to tackle because it has many different triggers and manifestations that vary across people.  You can alleviate some of the burden by using as many different educational tools as possible. These include books, health care professionals, and support groups. All of them can give you a more comprehensive, nuanced, and deeper skill set for living with eczema.
