1,	Maximum	contribution	to	the	floor	of	orbit is	by:,1,Anatomy,Head and Neck,Orbit,Maxillary,,"Correct	Answer	-	A Ans.	A.	Maxillary The	maxillae	are	the	largest	of	the	facial	bones,	other	than	the mandible,	and	jointly	form	the	whole	of	the	upper	jaw.	Each	bone forms	the	greater	part	of	the	floor	and	lateral	wall	of	the	nasal	cavity, and	of	the	floor	of	the	orbit ""Orbital	surface	of	maxilla	is	smooth	and	triangular,	and	forms most	of	the	floor	of	the	orbit"" Also	know: Maxilla	is	also	the	most	commonly	fractured	bone	of	orbital	floor. The	floor	(inferior	wall)	is	formed	by	the	orbital	surface	of	maxilla,	the orbital	surface	of	Zygomatic	bone	and	the	orbital	process	of	palatine bone The	seven	bones	that	articulate	to	the	orbit	are 1.	Frontal	bone 2.	Lacrimal	bone 3.	Ethmoid	bone 4.	Zygomatic	bone 5.	Maxillary	bone 6.	Palatine	bone 7.	Sphenoid	bone",Beginner,Maxillary,Zygomatic,Sphenoid,Palatine
