1,"	Maximum	contribution	to	the	floor	of	orbit is	by:",1,Anatomy,Head and Neck,Orbit,Maxillary,,"Correct	Answer	-	A Ans.	A.	Maxillary The	maxillae	are	the	largest	of	the	facial	bones,	other	than	the mandible,	and	jointly	form	the	whole	of	the	upper	jaw.	Each	bone forms	the	greater	part	of	the	floor	and	lateral	wall	of	the	nasal	cavity, and	of	the	floor	of	the	orbit ""Orbital	surface	of	maxilla	is	smooth	and	triangular,	and	forms most	of	the	floor	of	the	orbit"" Also	know: Maxilla	is	also	the	most	commonly	fractured	bone	of	orbital	floor. The	floor	(inferior	wall)	is	formed	by	the	orbital	surface	of	maxilla,	the orbital	surface	of	Zygomatic	bone	and	the	orbital	process	of	palatine bone The	seven	bones	that	articulate	to	the	orbit	are 1.	Frontal	bone 2.	Lacrimal	bone 3.	Ethmoid	bone 4.	Zygomatic	bone 5.	Maxillary	bone 6.	Palatine	bone 7.	Sphenoid	bone",Beginner,Maxillary,Zygomatic,Sphenoid,Palatine,

3,Which is a typical intercostal nerve?,1,Anatomy,Thorax,Thoracic wall,Third,Test3,"Correct Answer - C Third ""Typical intercostal nerves are the ones that are confined to their own intercostal spaces in the thoracic wall. The third, fourth, fifth and sixth intercostal nerves are the typical nerves""",Beginner,First,Second,Third,Seventh,
4,Trendelenburg test is positive due to injury to which of the following nerve?,1,Anatomy,Lower Limb ,Hip Joint,Superior Gluteal,Test1,"Correct Answer - C Ans. C. Superior Gluteal A positive Trendelenburg is relatively non-specific and may indicate: Pain (e.g. due to osteoarthritis of the hip joint) Weak hip abductors (gluteus medius, gluteus minimus) Short femoral neck/ fracture of neck Dislocation or subluxation of the hip Neuropathy Gluteus medius and minimus are supplied by Superior Gluteal nerve. Trendelenburg test Normally when a person is made to stand on one leg, the hip abductors of the ipsilateral side raise the opposite and the unsupported side of the pelvis. If the abductor mechanism is defective, the unsupported side of the pelvis drops and this is known as positive Trendelenburg test.",Intermediate,Obturator,Sciatic,Superior Gluteal,Inferior Glutea,
5,Lateral boundary of cubital fossa is formed by,1,Anatomy,Upper Limb,Brachial Plexus,Brachioradialis,Test2,"Correct Answer - A Brachioradialis Boundaries of cubital fossaLaterally - Medial border of brachioradialis. Medially - Lateral border of pronator teres. Base - It is directed upwards, and is represented by an imaginary line joining the front of two epicondyles of the humerus. Apex - It is directed downwards, and is formed by the area where brachioradialis crosses the pronator teres muscle.",Intermediate,Brachioradialis,Pronator teres,Brachialis,Biceps,
6,". All of the following are structures associated with pterygopalatine fossa, EXCEPT",1,Anatomy,Head and Neck,Osteo-Base of skull,Mid third of maxillary artery,Test3,"Correct Answer - B The pterygopalatine fossa is the region between the pterygomaxillary fissure and the nasal cavity. * The fossa accommodates branches of the maxillary nerve [cranial nerve (CN) V-2], the pterygopalatine ganglion, the terminal branches of the maxillary artery, and greater superficial petrosal nerve",Intermediate,Pterygopalatine ganglion,Mid third of maxillary artery,Maxillary nerve,Greater petrosal nerve,
7,Which of the following is NOT a branch of 1st part of maxillary artery?,1,Anatomy,Head and Neck,Maxillery Artery,Greater palatine artery,Test1,"Correct Answer - D Branches of maxillary artery: The maxillary artery consists of three parts; mandibular part, pterygoid part, pterygopalatine part. Branches of mandibular part: Inferior alveolar artery Middle meningeal artery Deep auricular artery Anterior tympanic artery Occasionally an accessory meningeal branch. Branches of pterygoid part: Masseteric artery Deep temporal branches Pterygoid branches Buccal artery Branches of pterygopalatine part: Posterior superior alveolar artery Infraorbital artery Descending palatine artery Greater palatine artery Lesser palatine artery Sphenopalatine artery Lateral posterior nasal arteries Posterior septal branches",Expert,Middle meningeal artery,Accessory meningeal artery,Inferior alveolar artery,Greater palatine artery,
8, Ophthalmic artery is a branch of ?,1,Anatomy,Head and Neck,CN-opthalmic artery, Cerebral part of ICA,Test2,"Correct Answer - B The common carotid arteries bifurcate at the level of the thyroid cartilage into the external and internal carotid arteries. The external carotid artery sends branches to the neck and face, whereas the internal carotid artery ascends to the base of the skull, entering the carotid canal. Upon exiting the carotid canal, the internal carotid artery courses horizontally over the foramen lacerum and enters the cavernous sinus and, after turning superiorly, divides into its terminal branches. Internal carotid artery It is the main artery supplying structures inside the cranial cavity and orbit. It is divided into 4 parts :? * Cervical part :- It extends from upper border of thyroid cartilage to the base of skull. This part gives no branch. * Petrous part :- It lies in bony carotid canal in the petrous temporal bone. It gives two branches (i)Caroticotympanic, and (ii) pterygoid. * Cavernous part :- It runs through the medial wall of cavernous sinus. It gives three branches : (i) Meningeal branch, (ii) hypophyseal branch and (iii) cavernous branch. * Cerebral part :- It is related to inferior surface of cerebrum. It gives following branches: (i) Ophthalmic artery,(ii) posterior communicating artery, (iii) anterior choroidal artery, (iv) anterior cerebral artery and (v) middle cerebral artery.",Expert,Cavernous part of ICA,Cerebral part of ICA,MCA,Facial artery,
9, Postganglionic fibres to parotid gland is supplied by?,1,Anatomy,Head and Neck,Parotid gland,Auriculotemporal nerve,Test3,"Correct Answer - B Preganglionic nerves travel in the lesser petrosal branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve and synapse in the otic ganglion. Postganglionic fibers reach the gland via the auriculotemporal nerve. Nerve supply of parotid gland Innervation of the salivary gland is as follows:- Parasympathetic (secretomotor) : ? They reach the gland through auriculotemporal nerve as the following route:- Preganglionic fibers - Originate in the inferior salivary nucleus; pass through glossopharyngeal nerve; its tympanic branch; tympanic plexus, and lesser petrosal nerve. Relay ganglion:- Otic ganglion. Postganglionic fibers:- Pass through the auriculotemporal nerve to reach the gland. Sympathetic (Vasomotor) : ? Derived from the plexus around the middle meningeal artery. Sensory: derived from the auriculotemporal nerve, except for parotid fascia and overlying skin which are innervated by the great auricular nerve(c2, c3)",Expert,Glossopharyngeal nerve,Auriculotemporal nerve,Both of the above,None of the above,
